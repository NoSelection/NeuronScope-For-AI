About app

The goal of this system is to identify, test, and isolate the internal mechanisms that cause a model to produce a specific behavior.

The system exists to transform opaque model behavior into controllable, falsifiable, internal structure, without relying on external interpretation, generated explanations, or assumed intent.

Understanding, within this system, is defined as the ability to:

locate internal components associated with a behavior,

intervene on those components,

and predict the resulting change in behavior.

Any insight that does not increase controllability is considered incomplete.

The system does not seek to humanize, justify, or narrativize model behavior.
It seeks only to map cause to effect inside the model itself.
---------------------------------------
1. **The system must reveal mechanisms, not impressions.**
   Any output that cannot be causally tested is considered decorative and invalid.

2. **Every claim must be falsifiable inside the system itself.**
   If a result cannot be contradicted by an internal counter-run, it does not exist.

3. **Observations are data; explanations are artifacts.**
   Never confuse a generated explanation with evidence of internal reasoning.

4. **No hidden state is trusted by default.**
   All internal signals must be surfaced, transformed, or discarded explicitly.

5. **Causality beats correlation at all times.**
   Rankings without intervention are incomplete and must be treated as provisional.

6. **Interventions define understanding.**
   A component is only “important” if altering it produces a measurable effect.

7. **Reproducibility is a first-class constraint.**
   Any result that cannot be reproduced under controlled variation is noise.

8. **Scale is irrelevant to validity.**
   A result proven at small scale is not weaker than one observed at large scale.

9. **The system must degrade gracefully.**
   Partial visibility is acceptable; fabricated completeness is not.

10. **No external authority is assumed correct.**
    Prior literature may inform questions, never answers.

11. **All abstractions must map back to concrete internal states.**
    If a concept cannot be grounded in actual signals, it must be removed.

12. **Separation of outcome and process is mandatory.**
    The final output must never be used as evidence for how it was produced.

13. **Silence is preferable to speculation.**
    When uncertainty cannot be resolved internally, it must be preserved, not filled.

14. **The system must explain failure paths as clearly as success paths.**
    Errors are data, not exceptions.

15. **Nothing is optimized for appearance, only for insight.**
    Any feature that exists solely to look impressive violates the project.

16. **The system must remain legible to a future version of itself.**
    No assumption may rely on current context, trends, or hidden conventions.

17. **If two interpretations fit the data, both must survive.**
    Premature collapse of ambiguity is forbidden.

18. **Understanding is measured by controllability.**
    If behavior cannot be steered through identified mechanisms, it is not understood.
